reader-download.py will check a specific tag in Google Reader 
for updates, if there is a .torrent,  it will download it and open it with
the torent app of your choice. If it's not, it will simply download the 
file.

Seperate directories can be specified for saving .torrent files and
any other files. This way you can also download feeds with non-torrent
enclosures.
